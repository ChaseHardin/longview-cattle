Purchase this 4037 Hereford daughter (born Feb 2009) as a 7-yr old from the Phillip Renner Farm (part of the annual Roth Hereford sale).  6 natural calves on the ground and 6 more for Longview Farms â€“ 12 calves in total.  Wonderful disposition with udder/teats that hang level; of course, that deep body her sire 4037 carries.
