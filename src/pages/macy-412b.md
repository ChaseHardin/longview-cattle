Started our Mona Lisa cow line (homo black-72%); moved herself to the top of our herd; 25% Felton and 25% Weiss & Sons in her pedigree.  Udder/teats still close to perfect; 7 natural calves, the last one on May 3rd meaning she averages a calf every 365 days. She is long from pins to hooks and maintains a clean-smooth depth of rib phenotype look; a calving ease specialist w/ avg BW 76lbs or 94% ratio.
