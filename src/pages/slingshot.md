This Durango 44 bull calf weaned off at the 3rd highest WW which is primarily due to his DAM, a young Iron Slinger cow (2nd calf). This bull is black top bottom with good eye pigmentation. His 4 year old DAM, who has a lot of length, depth, and power is getting noticed and strongly considered for the donor pen. (BW 93 - WW 697 - YY 999)
