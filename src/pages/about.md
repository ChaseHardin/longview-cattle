THE FAMILY AND FARM LIFE
Longview Farms is celebrating 20 years of farm life and raising cattle; purchased Black Herefords in late 2009 - 12 years ago.  The Hardin family (w/ 4 kids) are pioneers who left the city life in 2002 and built our farm from nothing (open pastures and crop ground).  We learned and paid for many farm lessons through the school of “hard knocks”.  We built miles of fencing; trenched and laid thousands of feet of water pipeline (for intensive grazing) and learned how to survive winter’s frozen water issues with the cattle.  All our kids have PHD’s (professional post hold diggers). 

## THE DAIRY BOOT CAMP
We started with a grass-based dairy (first 4 years), which was our boot camp!  We experienced milk fever, cows stuck in the ditch, hypothermia, torn teats, saving bloated cows and much more.  Moved to beef cattle and worked through the discovery of MSUD (9-year journey).  We pushed forward with AI and flushing our best “genetically clean” cows (new red Herefords). Progress is being made; the cow herd gave us a 205 WW avg. of 615lbs (no creep feed) last year – not bad for Iowa.  

## THE HERD
We target a tight calving season (60 days or less), meaning fertility is an important trait for staying at Longview Farms.  We ask the bulls to do their breeding in July and August, the hottest most humid times in Iowa.  Cows must learn to survive on our summer fescue / clover mixed pastures, with only hay for the winter.  There is no grain once heifers get past 12 months of age.  As the kids grew up and started to leave home, we settled on an optimal herd size of 45-50 cows. It’s surprising; once the herd size is set there is a big surge in herd quality – culling happens for the smallest items.  

## COME VISIT THE FARM
As you look for a new herd bull, we welcome anyone to our farm and a special walk through the herd.  Farm visits are educational and recommended, if possible.  Please contact us to discuss your bulls needs and we will work to align your bull interest accordingly.  We can hold bulls until late April / early May at which time we will gather yearling data and conduct a full Breeding Soundness Exam.  Once tests are completed, we will work with you to schedule transportation.
