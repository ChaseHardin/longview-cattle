This is a young donor (2yrs old-88% purebred); carries 25% NJW Trust 100W and 25% NJW Hometown 10Y; meaning she carries one of NJW Hereford’s most popular females Daydream 73S (sired by Boomer P606) on both sides of her pedigree.  The Grandam’s from Longview were 9 and 10 years of age before they were each specific selected and sold to a clinic in Pennsylvania for a special research project.  Double googled eyed with already that deep ribbed – long gated phenotype design, this girl is early to the donor pen with all that history in her pedigree.
